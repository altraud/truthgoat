Truthgoat brings truth to the interwebz!

This is a project to create 1) a Chrome extension which allows users to easily post a fact-check comment (including links
to reputable fact-checker sources) on social media, when they encounter someone spreading false or misleading information
or news stories, and 2) a bot program that does the same thing, but automatically identifies false stories/comments to respond to
(initially, the bot will be aimed at reddit).

Current tasks:

1. Create an installable plugin file structure
2. Create graphic icons & assets & general front-end design
3. Build text analysis tool for cross-referencing articles from non-reputable sources (or user-submitted query strings) with fact-checker articles
4. Build scraper to pull articles from non-reputable sources onto server
5. Build scraper to pull articles from fact-checker sources onto server
6. Set up server with SPARK, Anaconda, any other necessary tools to handle requests
7. Create plugin user interface
8. Connect plugin UI behavior to server
9. Set up server to query databases and return array of relevant fact-check articles with appropriate message lead-in
10. Promotion strategy, logo, goat-related puns
